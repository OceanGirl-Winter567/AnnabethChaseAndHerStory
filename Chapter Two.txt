  When I talk to him at all it was just a sign of understandment not accully anything like questions. After I was told everything about being a demigod Clarresie showed my cabin. There was at least five kids in there. I shyly said "hi, do you know where I could put my stuff?" I was so scard still even though i've been kind of idtroduced. Even though I still did'nt really know this place. One of the other kids said "aww, who are you little one?" "i'm Annabeth" "Last name please" " Chase, Annabeth Chase" "oh its you, we were expecting you dear" If felt kind of safe around them. Maybe its just because their also daughters of Athena.
