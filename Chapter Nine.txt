  The next day I was nothing but embarassed. I didn't want to talk to Luke because I didn't want to pull him into all of this, but also because the whole reason the fight happend was because I was friends with Luke. (Again Rick I'm not trying to copywrite anything I am purly just trying to make stuff up from your charatcters)
  I stayed in the cabin all day, or at least as much as I could, I still had to go out for sword fighting which i'm really good at.
