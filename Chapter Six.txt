  "she's falling for it so hard!" wispered one of the girls.
  "ok that's enough Anna" another girl told me even though I didn't know what was even going on in the world.
  "did you take it away yet?" asked the main leader of the Athena kids.
  "just now mam" the same girl told her.
  "good, now how are we going to hide her from Chiron?" the leader asked.
  "we don't know" responded all the girls at same time.
  While they were trying to whatever they were trying to do to me I was trying to fight the mind control thing and was planning to run out of there, grab my knif, and attack all of them. When they all walked off, I gathered all the strenghth and control I had and manged to snap out of the trance. I ran out of the cabin as fast as possible, until the leader girl stoped in my way. She tried to make come back, because she though that I just got board and wanted to run around for a little bit. She grabed me, I struggled.
  "WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS!?" I yelled.
  "oh shut up Anna" she told me.
  "ITS ANNAB-" I tried to say but another girl cut me off.
  "ok I get it Anna" she told me, annoyed.
  I was just about to give in until.
  "HEY! YOU LET HER GO AND I WON'T REPORT YOU TO YOUR MOTHER!" Clarrisie threatend.
  "aww, did the little superhero come to save the victom?" asked the leader mockingly.
  "NO, BUT I WILL HAVE YOU FLYING OUT OF THE BOARDER AND ALL THE WAY TO CHINA IF YOU KEEP HER EVEN A SECOND LONGER!" she threatened.
  "jeez, ok, you can have her" the leader told her.
  "dang, being daughter of Athena, your pretty stupid" she told them.
  I thanked Clarriesie, by the way she reacted, I could tell she didn't get that many thank you's that ofter. I went back to my training again. I saw a guy with pale skin and blond hair standing there with no one to battle.
