  Five minutes into battle I was losing. I thought it was a stupid idea for me still kind of a new kid to be battling one of the best fighters on day two. I kept getting thrown on the ground by my own weapon, I was sure I wass going to lose this battle. Unitl thirty minutes in I was making both of them fly all the way on the table and have almost broke it.
  "HEY! BE CARFUL OVER HERE, WERE TRYING TO MAKE DINNER TO SERVE YOU AND YET YOU JUST COME CRASHING IN!" someone yelled.
  I didn't care, and in the end I won and really did have both of them flying all the way to the other side of Half-Blood Hill.
  "TALK ABOUT ME AGAIN I'LL KILL YOU!" I yelled.
  "hey, Annabeth, no killing anyone!" Chiron told me.
  Now both of my oppnents were crying while eveyone else was running tward them. I felt so Victorious that I could accully walk around confidently. I went back to my cabin and packed my things thinking that I was a daughter of Ares instead and that I was put in the wrong placment.
  "OH MY GODS ANNABETH, WHAT DID YOU DO TO YOUR OWN SIBLINGS, NOW THEIR CRYING SAYING THAT YOU BROKE THEIR ARM AND BOTH LEGS!" yelled one of my other siblings who weren't in the fight.
  "ITS NOT MY FAULT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT ME!" I yelled back. 
  I'll admit I did feel kind of bad for them but they shouldn't have been talking about me like that and this is a place where you train by fighting with real weapons that could hurt you pretty badly, so I also felt like I was jsut practicing outside of training time. I started to wonder how Luke felt about all of this, but I just ignored him because I wanted to look like someone who didn't need someone else to protect me. I went to ask Chiron if I was really a daughter of Athena or if I was confused with someone else and that i'm a daughter of Ares instead. Sadly i'm not I really wanted to move out and still do sometimes. I also wished I wasn't so advanced, I just wanted to be normal.
