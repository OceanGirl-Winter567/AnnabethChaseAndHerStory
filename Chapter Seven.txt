  "why don't I battle you?" I asked him.
  "uh sure why not" he replied.
    After that one battle me and him became friends. We became such best friends that we called eachother brother and sister. It sounded a little weird at first but we got used to it. I'm surprised how much we talk and every time the camp was doing an activity we were always paired together and we were pretty a pretty good pair.
