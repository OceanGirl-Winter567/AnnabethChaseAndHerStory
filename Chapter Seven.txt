  "why don't I battle you?" I asked him.
  "uh sure why not" he replied.
    After that one battle me and him became friends. We became such best friends that we called eachother brother and sister. It sounded a little weird at first but we got used to it. I'm surprised how much we talk and every time the camp was doing an activity we were always paired together and we were pretty a pretty good pair.
  Soon after that, people found out that we were friends, the whole camp started shipping us.
  "looks like you found a big man to protect you from us" I overheared the same girls saying.
  I walked up to them very offended, I told my friend to stay behind and that I needed to handle it myself. What I ment by that was battle them until I have my knif to their throat.
  "but before I go what's your name?" I asked.
  "Luke Castellan" he replied.
  "ok thanks" I said before walking off.
  The closer I got to them the more angry I got. 
  "HEY! YOU SAY I NEED A BIG STRONG MAN TO PROTECT ME, LETS TEST THAT THEOREY OUT IF YOUR WILLING TO!" I yelled.
  "aww look who came to join the party, why not?" they replied.
  "how about a two on one how does that sound?"
  "sounds perfect" I replied ready to have them flying across Half-Blood Hill.
