  "so, Annabeth i'm wondering, how did you get over the fact that you have been moved to a whole new life?" Chrion asked me.
  "oh, umm, I don't I guess i'm just that kind of person, i've always been like that my whole life" I replied.
  "ok, well, i'll be watching you closly, ok?" Chiron told me suspitiously.
  I didn't really feel weird about it though even though I always get weird about things like that. Maybe I was just impatiant to get back to doing whatever I was doing, which was sword fighting. I loved sword fighting back then, it felt like I was making history just because I was really good at sword fighting. As I was fighting I noticed Chiron looking at me more then anyone else, I guess he really ment it when he said he'd be watching over me closer then everyone else. 
  "umm Annabeth can I talk to you for a sec?" asked one of the other Athena kids.
  "sure let me just finish this guy off then i'll be there in a minute" I replied.
  "ok but hurry up, we need you ASAP" she told me.
  "ok but I can't really talk-fight so can you go now?" I told her. After I beat up my opponent again I quickly went over to see what they needed me for.
  "hey, your here" the same kid said.
  "yeah, so what do you need me for exactly?" I asked.
  "ok so you see my necklace right?" she asked.
  "I do what about it?" I responded
  "just keep looking at it ok?" she told me.
  While I was basicly in a trance they other girls were wispering with eachother.
