  I saw why they were all screaming on the top of their lungs like we were gonna die. We almost did die. But then the all famous Hercules bursted out of thin air and slaughtered the flamingo-bear. I was amazed, I was'nt sure if I just saw that or if I was dreaming. I wanted to run up to him and thank him for saving all of our lives. But as soon as I called out to him, he dissappered back into his time again. 
"guys I think its best if we get some rest" said Chiron.
But everyone was defenitly not gonna go to sleep any time soon after what we just saw. I was the only one to walk back to the cabin after seeing what we just saw. I'm not sure if they were but I heard them booing at me and telling me how boring I was. Now the same people want to be me. 
  I didn't go to sleep though instead I began writing again about something totally off topic. I noticed that I was really addicted to writing, maybe a little more then sword fighting. The next day everyone was still talking about what happend the night before. It was like the talk of the week. But we still had to do our daily training. Even though it was only my first week here I was the best fighter in the whole camp. Maybe I was very determainted to fight. In my normal as a kid i've always wanted a real sword. Now I got one. Training was a whole lot easier because people were still so dazed from Hercules. Thanks a lot Hercules now all I have to do is one strike and they fly of the ground. I think Chiron was a little surpried about how i'd gotten over it so quickly. Maybe it was the first time he's seen anyone like that.
